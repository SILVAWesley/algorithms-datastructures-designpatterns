/**
 * The Creator class declares the factory method that returns
 * new product objects. Itâ€™s important that the return type of
 * this method matches the product interface.
 * You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all
 * subclasses to implement their own versions of the method.
 * As an alternative, the base factory method
 * can return some default product type.
 * Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary
 * responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class
 * already has some core business logic related to products.
 * The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete
 * product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development
 * company can have a training department for programmers. However,
 * the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code,
 * not producing programmers.
